I moved to Teddington about 6 years ago and I regard it as home now. It's infamous for a few things, including the recently closed Teddington Studios where most of the TV programmes I grew up with were filmed, and the school opposite is responsible for giving Keira Knightley her interest in drama. 

Not everyone knows however that this was also the home of Sir Noel Coward, the infamous playwright, actor, director, composer and singer who was not only prominent in 1920s and 30s but also starred in The Italian Job alongside Michael Caine in 1969\. 

Private Lives was written in only 4 days and was an early success in the 1920s and was subsequently made into a film in 1931\. He cast himself in the first run alongside a little known actor at the time called Laurence Olivier.  

This time round the cast were Tom Chambers (Top Hat the musical and Strictly Come Dancing winner), Laura Rogers (Tipping the Velvet), Charlotte Ritchie (Call the Midwife and Fresh Meat) and Richard Teverson (Downton Abbey). 

The first thing which excited me was the set design of both acts. This production had clearly made a first class investment in this department and there was an incredibly smooth transition between the two. The first act was on adjacent balconies of their chosen honeymoon suites, with the second based inside a Parisian hotel. Both really well done and worthy of a mention in themselves, they added a valuable quality and additional dimension to the performance that was worthy of their effort. 

The play could well be set in modern times. Apart from the odd use of old words like 'cad' and the RP English more commonly found in normal use in it's day. All of the characters had a contemporary feel and strength about them with the arguments and fights between the couples not out of place on the set of Eastenders.
Coward, was clearly a master of audience engagement. There's not a minute that goes by without a quirky moment, amusing line, or even a song. Never a dull moment for sure, and the actors provided enough of a nod to the playwright while also giving it their own touch. The love scene in the second act was intimate and lovingly done, but it was almost banned in the 1920s as being too risqué. 

On the downside, the seats allocated had restricted viewing of the left hand side of the stage, resulting in several occasions where the audience roared with laughter as a result of the entrance of other actors, and a key moment was missed. Quite a few times there were lines delivered on the left hand seat which was also out of view. If I was you, I'd avoid any seats with a number higher than 20 and probably similar at the low end. 

A fun play, well written, wonderfully acted, and a set not to be missed.
Private Lives is at Richmond Theatre until Saturday 20th February before heading up to Glasgow and then onwards.
