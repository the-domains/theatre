Strictly Come Dancing has one of those Marmite followings. Love it or hate it, it has attracted TV audiences in their millions and is one of the few programmes to knock X-Factor off it's perch on a Saturday night. I wouldn't class myself as a fan, but I have watched it on occasions for some light entertainment. 

Regular viewers will know that Brendan Cole is one of the professional dancers, and always has something to say on the show, usually telling the judges off for unfair criticism. The Wimbledon Theatre was packed and an excitable buzz permeated the largely female audience and I realised that he was popular not just for his dancing. 

On stage he had about a dozen musicians, two singers, and a musical director playing the piano. Their job was to provide the musical backdrop and big sound required to keep the attention of a theatre audience, which they did very well.  The dance crew were much younger than the 39 year old, which made his lack of breath at the end of each number understandable. 

So with a talented team behind him, how was he going structure the show ? As the first few numbers completed, Brendan would talk to the audience and make attempts to connect with what he felt was a "Strictly" audience. However, many of the references to gossip on the TV programme, seemed to fall flat. I certainly wasn't aware of the nuances and names of the characters, and it seemed like the majority of the audience didn't either. Every time he'd mention Ilona (?), or Anton, knowingly, there would be a handful of people reacting. It actually settled me in, knowing I wasn't the only non-fan but appreciative of quality dancing. 

The show was structured very well, with a wide variety of dance numbers and enough change in costume, dancers and music, to keep the audiences attention. I soon starting drifting off. Not asleep, but more lost in the dance. I was feeling the artform at work as the smoke machine worked it's magic, the smooth tunes, coupled with the flowing and intimate dancing. I was hooked. 

The energy of his dance team was incredible. All of them were noticeably fit and well trained dancers and gave everything they had for each dance. Smiling while they did it. Who wants to watch someone dance with a serious face ? Brendan was the most charismatic. His face beams with enjoyment as he throws his partners up and around with grace. One thing that was noticeable was the level of his intimacy with his partners. It was focused, with sufficient care and attention, but it left enough space to say, this wasn't a love affair, it was a dance affair. This struck me as extremely professional and against the tide of press gossip of the show. You got the impression that here was a man, clearly aware of his attraction to women, but with enough integrity to maintain a healthy distance. 

Halfway through the show, there was a question and answer section, where he took questions forwarded from the audience. Many of the questions had guarded responses, and he pointed out that it was a press night, and he didn't want to fuel the various journalists with a fresh headline in the morning. At the same time, he did play around with some innuendo and actions, to tease his female fans, before swiftly mentioning his daughter and wife in the next sentence. 

Brendan Cole, is a true showman. He's been around on TV long enough to know what works for him, and what his audience want. As a dancer he is incredible to watch, and he certainly entertained the entire audience. 

One small thing I'd like to see less of, was the constant miming of lyrics during songs. It didn't work for me and was very distracting at times. In fact, it took the shine of some of the dance numbers, especially the one he dedicated to his daughter where he just about mimed every word. 

In summary, a fantastic night out for fans but also anyone who likes something a bit different for their live entertainment. Go with the girls, your mum or your partner, and be prepared to be mesmerised, enchanted and dazzled. 

A Night To Remember is touring until April.
